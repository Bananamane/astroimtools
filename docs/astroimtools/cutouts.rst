Cutout Helper Tools
===================

Cutout helper tools are useful for datasets from a large survey of multiple
sources, where there is a need to generate smaller cutout images of interest.
In addition, the tools also allow you to compose an RGB image from multiple
cutouts of the same target or pointing but in different wavelength regimes.

Below are `Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_
illustrating how to create cutout images of sources from a larger image.
You can also download the notebooks for your own use from
`the github repository for our notebooks <https://github.com/spacetelescope/astroimtools/tree/master/docs/astroimtools/notebooks/>`_:

* :doc:`Single-Band Cutouts <notebooks/make_cutouts>`
* :doc:`Lupton RGB Cutouts <notebooks/make_rgb>`
