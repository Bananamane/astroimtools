Cutout Helper Tools
===================

Cutout helper tools are useful for multi-object spectrograph (MOS) datasets,
where there is a need to generate smaller cutout images that are associated
with given spectra from a much larger survey image. In addition, the tools also
allow you to compose an RGB image from multiple cutouts of the same target
but in different wavelength regimes.

Below are `Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_
illustrating how to create cutout images of sources from a larger image.
You can also download the notebooks for your own use from
`the github repository for our notebooks <https://github.com/spacetelescope/astroimtools/tree/master/docs/astroimtools/notebooks/>`_:

* :doc:`Lupton RGB Cutouts <notebooks/make_rgb>`
