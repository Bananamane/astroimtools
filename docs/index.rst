Reporting Issues
================

If you have found a bug in Astroimtools please report it by creating a
new issue on the `Astroimtools GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/spacetelescope/astroimtools/issues>`_.

Please include an example that demonstrates the issue that will allow
the developers to reproduce and fix the problem. You may be asked to
also provide information about your operating system and a full Python
stack trace.  The developers will walk you through obtaining a stack
trace if it is necessary.


Contributing
============

Like the `Astropy`_ project, Astroimtools is made both by and for its
users.  We accept contributions at all levels, spanning the gamut from
fixing a typo in the documentation to developing a major new feature.
We welcome contributors who will abide by the `Python Software
Foundation Code of Conduct <https://python.org/psf/conduct/>`_.

Astroimtools follows the same workflow and coding guidelines as
`Astropy`_.  The following pages will help you get started with
contributing fixes, code, or documentation (no git or GitHub
experience necessary):
